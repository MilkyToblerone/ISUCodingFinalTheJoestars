## üéØ Overview

In this game, players:

* Create a custom character and receive a randomly assigned Stand or alternative power (Hamon or Spin)
* Are given a motivation and a unique main plotline
* Engage in a series of four AI-narrated battles
* Save and load their journey at any point
* Receive episodic summaries after each encounter, written in the tone and style of classic JoJo anime

The experience is enhanced by a dynamic prompt system, a custom stand designer, and structured save/load capabilities.
